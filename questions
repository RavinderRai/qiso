* Two connected graphs are isomorphic iff they are isometric as metric
  spaces. Is there an analoguous thing for quantum isomorphic graphs?
  In other words, can we capture the notion of quantum isomorphism by
  a relation on the associated metric spaces?

* Is the relation of d-quantum isomorphism (for a fixed d) an
  isomorphism? If not can we provide a counter-example?
