\section{Stabilizer Nullity}

\begin{definition}[Stabilizer]
Let $\ket{\psi}$ be a non-zero n-qubit state. The stabilizer of $\ket{\psi}$ is the sub-group of the Pauli group $\mathcal{P}_n$ on n qubits for which $\ket{\psi}$ is a $+1$ eigenstate, denoted by Stab$\ket{\psi}$. This means that Stab$\ket{\psi}$ = $\{P \in \mathcal{P}_n \: P \ket{\psi} = \ket{\psi} \}$. The states for which the size of the stabalizer is $2^n$are called stabalizer states. States for which the stabilizer contains only the identity matrix are said to have a trivial stabilizer. If Pauli $P$ is in Stab$\ket{\psi}$, we say that P stabilizes $\ket{\psi}$.
\end{definition}



\begin{proposition}
Let $\ket{\psi}$ be a non-zero n qubit state. Then we have the following facts about Stab$\ket{\psi}$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Stab$\ket{\psi}$ does not contain -$I$.
\item All Pauli group elements contained in Stab$\ket{\psi}$ commute with each other and are Hermitian matrices.
\item The size of the stabilizer is equal to some power of two.
\item Given any Clifford Unitary $C$, the size of Stab$\ket{\psi}$ is always equal to the size of Stab$(C \ket{\psi})$.
\item Finally, the size of the stabilizer is multiplicative for the tensor products of states, that is $| \text{Stab} (\ket{\psi} \ket{\phi})| = |\text{Stab}\ket{\psi}| \cdot |\text{Stab}\ket{\phi}|$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
\hspace{20mm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $\-I \in \text{Stab}\ket{\psi}$, then $-\ket{\psi} =-I\ket{\psi} = \ket{\psi}$, which of course is not true for non-zero states.

\item First note that for any two Pauli's $P, Q$, they either commute or anti-commute. Now suppose $P, Q \in \text{Stab}\ket{\psi}$ anti-commute. Then $\ket{\psi} = PQ\ket{\psi} = -QP\ket{\psi} = -\ket{\psi}$. This implies that $-I \in \text{Stab}\ket{\psi}$, which from above can't be true, so $P$ and $Q$ must commute.

\item It is known that the Pauli group's cardinality is a power of two, and since $\text{Stab}\ket{\psi}$ is a subgroup of the Pauli group, $|\text{Stab}\ket{\psi}|$ must divide a power of two, thus it must also be a power of two.

\item First note that Clifford unitaries normalize pauli matrices, i.e. for some Clifford unitary $C$, and some pauli $P$, $CPC^{\dag} = P'$, where $P'$ is also a pauli. Now let $P \in \text{Stab}\ket{\psi}$ and let $C$ be some Clifford unitary. Then $P'C\ket{\psi} = CPC^{\dag}C\ket{\psi} = CP\ket{\psi} = C\ket{\psi}$, so $P' \in \text{Stab}(C\ket{\psi})$. Now consider the map $\theta_C : \text{Stab}\ket{\psi} \rightarrow \text{Stab}(C\ket{\psi})$ which takes elements $P \mapsto CPC^{\dag} = P'$. This map has an inverse, $\theta_{C^\dag}: \text{Stab}(C\ket{\psi}) \longrightarrow \text{Stab}(C^{\dag}C\ket{\psi})$, which takes elements $P' \mapsto C^{\dag}P'C$ (where we note that $\text{Stab}(C^{\dag}C\ket{\psi}) = \text{Stab}\ket{\psi}$). Thus $\theta_C$ is a bijection, and so we have that $|\text{Stab}\ket{\psi}| = |\text{Stab}(C\ket{\psi})|$.

\item Let $\ket{\phi}$ be another non-zero state on n qubits, and let $P \in \text{Stab}\ket{\psi}$ and $Q \in \text{Stab}\ket{\phi}$. Then $P \otimes Q \ket{\psi}\ket{\phi} = P\ket{\psi} \otimes Q\ket{\phi} = \ket{\psi}\ket{\phi}$. So $P \otimes Q \in \text{Stab}\ket{\psi}\ket{\phi}$. Now let $R \in \text{Stab}\ket{\psi}\ket{\phi}$. Then since $R$ is a Pauli, we can write $R = R_1 \otimes R_2$, and $R\ket{\psi}\ket{\phi} = \ket{\psi}\ket{\phi} = R_1 \otimes R_2 \ket{\psi}\ket{\phi} \Longrightarrow R_1 \in \text{Stab}\ket{\psi} \hspace{1mm} \text{and} \hspace{1mm} R_2 \in \text{Stab}\ket{\phi}$. So every element in $\text{Stab}\ket{\psi}\ket{\phi}$ is of the form $R_1 \otimes R_2$ as above, thus $\text{Stab}\ket{\psi}\ket{\phi} = \text{Stab}\ket{\psi} \otimes \text{Stab}\ket{\phi}$. Then we have a bijection (from the direct product) $\theta:\text{Stab}\ket{\psi} \times \text{Stab}\ket{\phi} \longrightarrow  \text{Stab}\ket{\psi} \otimes \text{Stab}\ket{\phi}$, which gives us $|\text{Stab}\ket{\psi}\ket{\phi}| = |\text{Stab}\ket{\psi} \otimes \text{Stab}\ket{\phi}| = |\text{Stab}\ket{\psi}| \cdot |\text{Stab}\ket{\phi}|$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}



An example of a stabilizer state is the $\ket{0}$ state, since there are $2^1$ pauli's that stabilize it, namely $I$ and $Z$. Note that for any Clifford $C$, $|\text{Stab}\ket{0}| = |Stab(C\ket{0})| = 2^1 \implies C\ket{0}$ is a stabilizer state.
An example of a non-stabilizer state is the first bell state $\beta_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{00} + \ket{11})$, which through computation one can find that it has the following stabilizers: $I \otimes I$, $X \otimes X$, and $Z \otimes Z$. Since there are exactly $3$ stabilizers, and $3$ is not a power of $2$, $\beta_1$ cannot be a stabilizer state.

\begin{corollary}
The computational basis state $\ket{00 \dots 0}$ on n-qubits is a stabilizer state. If $\ket{\psi}$ is a Stabilizer state, then there is a Clifford unitary $C$ such that $C\ket{\phi} = \ket{\psi}$, where $\ket{\phi}$ is a computational basis state.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
First we prove that $\ket{00 \dots 0}$ is a stabilizer state by induction, where the base case is the $\ket{0}$ state which we know is a stabilizer state from above (and $|\text{Stab}\ket{0}| = 2^1$). Now assume that $\ket{00 \dots 0}$ is a stabilizer state on n-qubits with $|\text{Stab}\ket{00 \dots 0}| = 2^k$. Let $P \in \text{Stab}\ket{0}$ and $Q \in \text{Stab}\ket{00 \dots 0}$, then $(P \otimes Q)\ket{0}\ket{00 \dots 0} = P\ket{0} \otimes Q\ket{00 \dots 0} = \ket{0}\ket{00 \dots 0} = \ket{00 \dots 00}$ (n+1 qubits). So $P \otimes Q \in \text{Stab}\ket{00 \dots 00}$, and from above arguments we know that every element in $\text{Stab}\ket{00 \dots 00}$ is of this form, thus there are $2^{k+1}$ elements in $\text{Stab}\ket{00 \dots 00}$, making it a stabilizer state.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
Let $\ket{\psi}$ be a non-zero n-qubit state. The Stabilizer nullity of $\ket{\psi}$ is $\nu(\ket{\psi}) = n - log_2 |\text{Stab}\ket{\psi}|$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
Let $\ket{\psi}$ be a non-zero n-qubit state and let $P$ be an n-qubit Pauli matrix and suppose that the probability of a $+1$ outcome when measuring $P$ on $\ket{\psi}$ is non-zero. Then there are two alternatives for the state $\ket{\phi}$ after measurement: either $|\text{Stab}\ket{\phi}| = |\text{Stab}\ket{\psi}|$ or $|\text{Stab}\ket{\phi}| \geq 2|\text{Stab}\ket{\psi}|$, both of which satisfy $\nu(\ket{\phi}) \leq \nu(\ket{\psi})$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
First consider the simple case when $P$ is in Stab$\ket{\psi}$. In this case, the "+1" measurement outcome occurs with probability $1$ and $\ket{\psi}$ is unchanged. When $P$ is not in Stab$\ket{\psi}$ we consider two alternatives. The first alternative is that $P$ commutes with all elements of Stab$\ket{\psi}$. Recall we have the post-measurement state $\ket{\phi} = \frac{P\ket{\psi}}{\sqrt{\bra{\psi}P^{\dag}P\ket{\psi}}} = \frac{P\ket{\psi}}{\sqrt{\bra{\psi}\ket{\psi}}}$, and let $Q \in \text{Stab}\ket{\psi}$. Then $Q\ket{\phi} = \frac{QP\ket{\psi}}{\sqrt{\bra{\psi}\ket{\psi}}} = \frac{PQ\ket{\psi}}{\sqrt{\bra{\psi}\ket{\psi}}} = \frac{P\ket{\psi}}{\sqrt{\bra{\psi}\ket{\psi}}} = \ket{\phi}$. Note also that Stab$\ket{\phi}$ also contains $P$Stab$\ket{\psi}$, and thus Stab$\ket{\phi}$ contains Stab$\ket{\psi}$ $\cup$ $P$Stab$\ket{\psi}$ and thus its size is at least $2| \text{Stab}\ket{\psi}|$.

The second alternative is when $P$ anti-commutes with some element $Q \in$ Stab$\ket{\psi}$. Note that $Q\ket{\psi} = \ket{\psi}$ and $QPQ = -P$, so the probability of the $+1$ outcome is $\bra{\psi}(I+P)\ket{\psi}/2 = \bra{\psi}Q(I+P)Q\ket{\psi}/2 = \bra{\psi}(I-P)\ket{\psi}/2$, which is the probability of the $-1$ outcome. Thus the probability of the $+1$ outcome is $1/2$. Then $\ket{\phi} = (I+P)/\sqrt{2}\ket{\psi}$ where we fixed the normalization condition such that $\bra{\phi}\ket{\phi} = \bra{\psi}\ket{\psi}$. Also, observe that we can write $\ket{\phi} = (I+PQ)/\sqrt{2}\ket{\psi}$. Since $(I+PQ)/\sqrt{2}$ is a Clifford unitary equal to exp($i\pi P'/4)$ for $P' = iPQ$, we see that $\ket{\phi}$ and $\ket{\psi}$ differ by a Clifford and therefore $|$Stab$\ket{\psi}| = |$Stab$\ket{\phi}|$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Pauli Spectrum]
Let $\ket{\psi}$ be a non-zero n-qubit state. The Pauli spectrum Spec$\ket{\psi}$ of $\psi$ is:
\begin{equation}
\text{Spec}\ket{\psi} = \left\{ \frac{|\bra{\psi}P\ket{\psi}|}{\braket{\psi|\psi}}, \forall P \in \{I, X, Y, Z\}^{\otimes n} \right\}
\end{equation}
The Pauli spectrum is a list of $4^n$ real numbers each between 0 and 1 which is invariant under Clifford gates. Consider the following example.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
The Pauli spectrum of the state $\ket{\theta} = (\ket{0} + e^{i\theta}\ket{1})/\sqrt{2}$ is $\{1, cos\theta, sin\theta, 0\}$. The state $\ket{\theta}$ is therefore a stabilizer state only for $\theta = m \pi/2$ for some integer m.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
First note that $\ket{\theta}$ is normalized so $\bra{\theta}\ket{\theta} = 1$. Now by direct computation, we have:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\bra{\theta}I\ket{\theta} = \braket{\theta|\theta} = 1$
\item $\bra{\theta}X\ket{\theta} = (\bra{1}e^{-i\theta} + \bra{0})(\ket{1} + e^{i\theta}\ket{0})/2 = (e^{-i\theta} + e^{i\theta})/2 = cos\theta$
\item $\bra{\theta}Y\ket{\theta} = (\bra{1}e^{-i\theta} + \bra{0})(i\ket{1} - ie^{i\theta}\ket{0})/2 = i(e^{-i\theta} - e^{i\theta})/2 = i(-2sin\theta)/2 = sin\theta$
\item $\bra{\theta}Z\ket{\theta} = (\bra{1}e^{-i\theta} + \bra{0})(\ket{0} - e^{i\theta}\ket{1})/2 = 1 - 1 = 0$
\end{itemize} 
Moreover, if $\theta = 2k\pi /2$ for some integer $k$, then $X \in \text{Stab}\ket{\theta}$, and if $\theta = (2k+1)\pi /2$, then $Y \in \text{Stab}\ket{\theta}$. Observe that $\forall \theta$, $I \in \text{Stab}\ket{\theta}$ and $Z \not\in \text{Stab}\ket{\theta}$, thus $|\text{Stab}\ket{\theta}| = 2$ if and only if either $X$ or $Y \in \text{Stab}\ket{\theta}$, or more generally if $\theta = m \pi /2$, for some integer $m$.
\end{proof}
Note that the number of 1s in the Pauli spectrum of $\ket{\psi}$ is $|\text{Stab}\ket{\psi}|$.

\section{Catalysis}

\begin{theorem}
Let F be a number field which contains $\mathbb{Q}(i)$ and which is closed under complex conjugation. Any stabilizer circuit applied to a density matrix with all entries in F produces a density matrix with all entries in F, with both density matrices written in the computational basis.
\end{theorem}

For example, no stabilizer circuit on any number of $\ket{CS}$ or $\ket{CCZ}$ states (which have density matrices with all entries in $\mathbb{Q}(i)$) can be used to produce a $\ket{T}$ state (which has a density matrix with all entries in $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_8)$). Similarly, no stabilizer circuit on any number of $\ket{T}$ states can be used to produce a $\ket{\sqrt{T}}$ state (with entries in $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{16})$).
 
\begin{proof}
Suppose our stabilizer circuit acts upon $N$ qubits initially in the $\ket{0}$ state. Clearly the density matrix $\rho_{initial} = (\ket{0}\bra{0})^{\otimes n}$ has entries over $\mathbb{Q}$. We point out that all Clifford unitaries can be written as matrices with entries over $\mathbb{Q}(i)$, and therefore as matrices with entries over F. Explicitly, the Clifford group is generated by $H$, $CZ$, and $S$ which are defined as:
\begin{align*}
H = \frac{1}{1+i} 
\left[
\begin{matrix}
1 & 1 \\
1 & 1
\end{matrix}
\right]
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
S: \ket{0} \mapsto \ket{0} , \ket{1} \mapsto \ket{1}
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
CZ: \ket{ab} \mapsto (-1)^{a \wedge b}\ket{ab}
\end{align*}
Given any gate U in the circuit is a tensor product of a unitary with entries over F and I and $\rho$ has entries over F the product $U\rho U^{\dag}$ is a density matrix with entries over F. Therefore applying the gates in the circuit preserves the required property. Note that measurement with or without post-selection can be described as:
\begin{align*}
\rho \mapsto \frac{P\rho P}{Tr\rho P}
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
\rho \mapsto \sum_{P \in \mathcal{P}} P\rho P
\end{align*}
The projectors $P$ above correspond to measurement in the computational basis and therefore can be written as matrices with entries over $\mathbb{Q}(i)$ and therefore over F. The product of matrices over F is a matrix over F. The trace of a matrix over F is also in F by the definition of a field. The quotient of a matrix over F and an element of F is again a matrix over F because any field is closed under the division operation. This completes the proof. 
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Conversion Notation]
The equation $\ket{A} \rightarrow \ket{B}$ indicates that resource state $\ket{A}$ can be converted into resource state $\ket{B}$ with stabilizer operations in the absences of a catalyst. On the other hand, $\ket{A} \xRightarrow{\ket{C}} \ket{B}$, which is equivalent to $\ket{A}\ket{C} \rightarrow \ket{B}\ket{C}$, indicates the conversion can proceed with the use of a catalyst $\ket{C}$ (which may sometimes be omitted above the arrow). When a process is impossible, we strike through the arrow, for example $\ket{A} \nRightarrow \ket{B}$ signifies that $\ket{A}$ cannot be converted to $\ket{B}$ by stabilizer operations even in the presence of an arbitrary catalyst. In cases involving multiple copies of a given state such as $\ket{A}^{\otimes 2} \xRightarrow{\ket{C}} \ket{B}$, we sometimes write $2\ket{A} \xRightarrow{\ket{C}} \ket{B}$ to avoid clutter.
\end{definition}

\chapter{Conversion of Resource States}
\begin{theorem}
Let $\ket{U}$ be an n-qubit magic state for a diagonal unitary $U$ from the $3^{\text{rd}}$ level of the Clifford hierarchy, and let $\tau (U)$ be the minimum number of T gates needed to implement $U$ using the gate set $\{CNOT, S, T\}$. The following resource conversion is possible


$\ket{U} \xRightarrow{\ket{T}^{\otimes \tau (U) - \nu (\ket{U}}} \ket{T}^{\otimes 2 \nu (\ket{U}) - \tau (U)}$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Recall the following phase polynomial formalism. For any diagonal unitary in the $3^{\text{rd}}$ level Clifford hierarchy we have $U_f = \sum_x exp(if(x) \pi/4) \ket{x}\bra{x}$, where $f:\mathbb{Z}_2^n \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_8$ is of cubic form and so can be decomposed as the phase polynomial $f(x) = \sum_{a_k \neq 0} a_k \lambda_k (x)$ (mod 8) where $a_k \in \mathbb{Z}_8$ and each $\lambda_k$ is a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ linear function. That is, each $\lambda_k$ has the form $\lambda_k (x) = (P_{1, k}x_1) \oplus (P_{2, k}, x_2) \dots (P_{n, k}, x_n)$ (mod 2) where $P_{j, k}$ are binary. Thus we can describe the function by a binary matrix $P$ and vector $a$, with columns corresponding to nonzero $a_k$ (so the number of columns is the number of terms in $f$). For a function with a single term $f(x) = a_k \lambda_k(x)$, an easily verified circuit decomposition is 
$U_{\lambda_k} = \sum_x exp(i\lambda_k(x) \pi/4) \ket{x}\bra{x} = V^{\dag}_{CNOT(\lambda_k)}T_1^{a_k}V_{CNOT(\lambda_k)}$ where $T_1$ is a $T$ gate acting on qubit 1 and $V_{CNOT(\lambda_k)}$ is a cascade of CNOT gates such that 

$V_{CNOT(\lambda_k)} \ket{x} = V_{CNOT(\lambda_k)} \ket{x_1, x_2, \dots x_n} = \ket{\lambda_k(x_1), x_2, \dots x_n}$.

Now note that if $a_k$ is even then $T_a^{a_k} = S_1^{a_k/2}$ is a Clifford and the whole circuit is Clifford. But if $a_k$ is odd then $T_1^{a_k} = T_1S_1^{(a_k - 1)/2}$ and only a single $T$ gate is used. Now, generalizing to a phase polynomial $f$ with many terms we have $U_f = \displaystyle \prod_k U_{\lambda_k}$  and so the $T$-count for the associated circuit is equal to the number of odd valued $a_k$ (so if all values are even then the unitary is Clifford).


This allows us to split the unitary $U_f$ into a Clifford and non-Clifford part. For each $a_k$ coefficient, we define $b_k \in \mathbb{Z}_4$ and $c_k \in \mathbb{Z}_2$ such that $a_k = 2b_k +c_k$ (so $c_k = 1$ if and only if $a_k$ is odd). Now for functions $g(x) = \displaystyle \sum_{c_k \neq 0} c_k \lambda_k(x)$ and $h(x) = \displaystyle \sum_{b_k \neq 0} b_k \lambda_k(x)$ we have that $f = g + h$ and $U_f = U_{g+2h} = U_gU_{2h}$ where $U_{2h}$ is a Clifford Unitary. The non-Clifford part is $U_g$ and all the terms have odd valued co-coefficients, so the number of terms in $g$ gives an upper bound on $\tau(U_g)$ as discussed earlier. It follows that if the function $g$ has $m$ (odd-valued) terms then the state can be prepared using $m$ many $T$ gates/states. Note that for any given unitary $U_g$ there is an equivalence class of different functions $g$ that all result in the same unitary but with different numbers of terms. From now on we will assume that $g$ is the optimal representative with the fewest number of terms, denoted by $\tau(U_g)$. Furthermore, there is a binary matrix $P$ description of $g$ with a number of columns also equal to $\tau (U_g)$. A trivial but relevant example is $U = T^{\otimes n}$ for which $P = \mathds{1}_n$ and $\tau (T^{\otimes n}) = n$.

The next important step is that given a unitary $U_g$ we may also be able to remove terms from g by applying inverse $T$ gates. More generally, given two such unitaries $U_g$ and $U_{g'}$ with phase polynomials $g$ and $g'$, we have that $U_{g'} = U_g U_{\Delta}$ where $\Delta = g - g'$. Therefore, 
\begin{equation}
\ket{U_{g'}} = U_{\Delta} \ket{U_g}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
\ket{T}^{\otimes \tau (U_{\Delta})} \ket{U_{g'}} \rightarrow \ket{U_g}
\end{equation}
The number of $T$ states needed is $\tau (U_{\Delta})$, which just the number of terms where $g$ and $g'$ differ.

Using arguments from \cite{?}, given any $P$ we can always bring it into row-reduced echelon form using a CNOT circuit. Then
\begin{equation}
P = \begin{pmatrix}
\mathds{1}_r & A \\
0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
where $\mathds{1}_r$ is an identity matrix of size $r := \text{rank}(P)$. If $P$ is full rank the additional 0 padding is not present. Note that if $P$ has any 0 rows then the unitary acts trivially on the corresponding qubits leaving them in the $\ket{+}$ state, meaning that $\ket{U} = U\ket{+} = \ket{\psi}\ket{+}^{\otimes (n-r)}$ for some state $\ket{\psi}$. Also, for an $n$ qubit stabilizer state $\ket{\phi}$, 
\begin{equation}
\nu (\ket{\phi}) = 0 \Rightarrow \text{log}_2 |Stab\ket{\phi}| = n
\end{equation} 
Next, observe that 


\begin{align*}
\text{log}_2 |Stab\ket{U}| = & \text{log}_2|Stab(\ket{\psi}\ket{+}^{\otimes (n-r)})| \\ 
= & \text{log}_2 (|Stab \ket{\psi}| \cdot |Stab\ket{+}^{\otimes (n-r)}|) \\
= & \text{log}_2 |Stab \ket{\psi}| + \text{log}_2 |Stab \ket{+}^{\otimes (n-r)}|
= & \text{log}_2 |Stab \ket{\psi}| + (n-r)
= & \alpha + n - r
\end{align*}
for some positive integer $\alpha = \text{log}_2 |Stab \ket{\psi}|$. Hence log$_2|Stab\ket{U}| \geq n - r$, so rearranging we have that $n - \text{log}_2 |Stab \ket{U}| = \nu (\ket{U}) \leq r$.

Using our earlier argument, we can always remove from $P$ the columns corresponding to the matrix $A$ using a number of $T$ states equal to the number of columns in $A$. Since $A$ has $\tau (U_g) - r$ columns, this requires the same quantity of $T$ states. The resulting $U_{g'}$ has $P' = \mathds{1}_r$ (with possibly some 0 row padding) which corresponds to $r$ copies of $T$ states. Therefore, we can perform 
\begin{equation}
\ket{U_g}\ket{T}^{\otimes (\tau (U_g) - r)} \rightarrow \ket{T}^{\otimes r}
\end{equation}
If $r = \nu (U_g)$ then we have the result of the theorem. If $r \textgreater \nu (U_g)$ then the result is even stronger than the theorem, and so the theorem holds in either case.
\end{proof}
